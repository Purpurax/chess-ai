next todo:
- queen upgrade

- fully block user interaction, if agent is playing
- game imports and exports (general chess notation)

- agent selection menu
- win/restart menu
- display captured pieces
- change outlines when agent plays, maybe a blue outline or some indication

- profile and optimize anything

## Minimax
- parallel computing
- caching
- alpha beta border pruning

## MCTS
It is bad because of the random selection as that makes the agent not being able to judge if a move is very good, very bad, or ok. epsilon-greedy selection should counteract this.
- Change to epsilon-greedy selection in the MC simulation node selection policy


## Neural Networks
- create new agent

### en pasant
This rule is not being considered as it complicates the code for no reason.
